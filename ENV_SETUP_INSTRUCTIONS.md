# Environment Variables Setup

## âœ… What You Need to Add to Your `.env` File

Since the `.env` file already contains Supabase and Resend credentials, you only need to add the assessor emails.

### Add This Line to Your `.env` File

Add this at the end of your `.env` file (after line 22):

```env
# Assessor Emails (receives submission notifications)
# For multiple assessors, separate emails with commas
ASSESSOR_EMAIL=jeffrey.de.wee@circletel.co.za,hrmanager@newgenmc.co.za
```

### Complete `.env` File Structure

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```env

## ðŸ“§ How Multiple Assessor Emails Work

When a candidate submits their assessment:

1. **Candidate receives**: Confirmation email at their submitted email address
2. **Both assessors receive**: Notification email with:
   - Candidate's name and email
   - Selected challenge
   - Link to submission
   - Candidate's approach explanation
   - Time spent

The system automatically sends to all emails listed in `ASSESSOR_EMAIL` (comma-separated).

## âœ… Quick Verification

After adding the assessor emails:

1. Save the `.env` file
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Test a submission
4. Check that both assessors receive the notification email

## ðŸš€ For Netlify Deployment

When deploying to Netlify, add this environment variable:

**Variable Name**: `ASSESSOR_EMAIL`  
**Value**: `jeffrey.de.wee@circletel.co.za,hrmanager@newgenmc.co.za`

Both assessors will receive notifications for all submissions.
